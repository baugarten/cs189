Running everything is easy.

For problem 1,
run the file code/prob1 with no arguments
it will plot the results of the default parameters
along with the concoction of parameters that I found worked best.

For problem 2,
run the file code/prob2
I suggest running it with an argument.
The default behavior is to plot a confusion matrix for each of the 7 training sets.
Just pass in a numerical argument for which training set (1-7)
i.e. prob2(1) 
I find that the first training set its easiest to visualize the mistakes because there are more of them

prob3 I didn't fully automate.
I used the file prob3, using a small and giant bounds and a larger step size
and then manually closed in on the ideal value of C.
You can run prob3 to get a feel for how it works (its a little slow, you can
adjust the step size)
